# Primitive-Numbers
This program checks to see if a modular field has any primitive numbers and produces the elements that are primitive numbers. There is a fun version of this code and a more practical version of this code. 

What is a Primitive Number? A primitive number is an element of a modular field that generates all other elements of the field when raised to consecutive powers.
