# Primitive-Numbers
This program checks to see if a ring modulo n has any primitive numbers and produces the elements that are primitive numbers. There is a fun version of this code and a more practical version of this code. 

What is a Primitive Number? A primitive number is an element of a ring molulo that generates all other elements of the ring when raised to consecutive powers.
